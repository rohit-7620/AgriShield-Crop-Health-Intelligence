AGRISHIELD – FULL END-TO-END AI PIPELINE
# Dataset → Training → Prediction → UI
# AgriShield - Crop Health Intelligence

AgriShield is a full end-to-end AI pipeline designed for crop disease detection. 
The project leverages deep learning to analyze crop images and provide health insights.

### Project Pipeline:
* **Dataset:** Curated images of various crop species and diseases.
* **Training:** Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) optimized for accuracy.
* **Prediction:** Real-time inference through the `app.py` script.
* **UI:** A user-friendly interface for uploading images and viewing results.
